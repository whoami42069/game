# NEXUS ETERNAL - Game Architecture Document

## Game Concept
**Title**: Nexus Eternal
**Genre**: Cyberpunk Boss Rush Arena
**Theme**: Infinite digital combat in a neon-soaked virtual reality

### Core Loop
- Fight an evolving AI boss in an endless arena
- Each victory makes the boss stronger and smarter
- Score multipliers increase with consecutive hits
- Power-ups spawn based on performance
- The game never ends - only your high score matters

## Visual Design

### Art Direction
- **Aesthetic**: Cyberpunk meets Tron with vaporwave influences
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Neon cyan (#00FFFF), Hot magenta (#FF00FF)
  - Secondary: Electric purple (#9D00FF), Laser green (#00FF00)

## Game Entities

### Player Character
```typescript
class Player {
  // Movement
  position: Vector3
  velocity: Vector3
  acceleration: number = 80
  maxSpeed: number = 12
  dashSpeed: number = 30
  
  // Combat
  health: number = 100
  maxHealth: number = 100
  damage: number = 10
  critChance: number = 0.15
  comboMultiplier: number = 1
  
  // Abilities
  abilities: {
    slash: SlashAttack      // Quick melee
    blast: EnergyBlast      // Ranged projectile
    nova: PulseNova         // AOE burst
    overdrive: Overdrive    // Temporary power boost
  }
}
```

### Boss System
```typescript
class Boss {
  level: number = 1
  
  // Scaling formulas
  health = 100 * (1.5 ^ level)
  damage = 10 * (1.2 ^ level)
  speed = 5 * (1.1 ^ level)
  
  // Attack patterns that evolve
  patterns: AttackPattern[] = [
    new LaserBarrage(level),
    new ShockwaveSlam(level),
    new HomingMissiles(level),
    new QuantumDash(level),
    new VoidSphere(level)  // Unlocks at level 5
  ]
  
  // AI that learns
  aiPersonality: {
    aggression: number      // Increases with level
    prediction: number      // Learns player patterns
    adaptability: number    // Changes tactics
  }
}
```

## Scoring System

### Score Calculation
```
Base Score = Damage Dealt * Combo Multiplier * Time Bonus
Level Bonus = Boss Level * 1000
Style Points = (Perfect Dodges * 50) + (Parries * 100) + (No-Hit Bonus * 500)
Total Score = Base Score + Level Bonus + Style Points
```

### Multipliers
- Combo System: 1x → 2x → 4x → 8x → 16x (MAX)
- Time Attack: Faster kills = higher multiplier
- Perfect Play: No damage taken = 2x total score
- Risk/Reward: Low health = damage multiplier increases
