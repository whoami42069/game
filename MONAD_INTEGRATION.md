## Features Implemented

- **Privy App ID**: `cmeg9jzf4009oib0by8nw41ml`
- Cross-App authentication enabled
- Embedded wallets configured

### 2. Blockchain Score Submission
- Scores are submitted to Monad testnet after:
  - Each wave/boss defeat
  - Game over
- Transaction data includes:
  - Player score
  - Player wallet address
  - Timestamp
- Using private key wallet for signing transactions

### 3. Global Leaderboard
- Displays top 5 players
- Wallet addresses are clickable links to Monad explorer
- Shows player scores with visual hierarchy (medals for top 3)
- Stores transaction hashes with entries

### 4. Wallet Integration
- Private key: `0xb9723232c9872dac79024b92fff1f34ae8006c8002a086b1fdb3b5df66bd7eb3`
- RPC URL: `https://testnet.monad.network`
- Explorer: `https://testnet.monadexplorer.com`

## Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmeg9jzf4009oib0by8nw41ml
VITE_PRIVY_APP_SECRET=hoZYhE99FsoQMDoAMMdmLbXBFooSRXST9aZsNZRPqB8SjaLvpbGTPSgHxX187WHcFafUVCHsnpcFN3VCdB77pF5
VITE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xb9723232c9872dac79024b92fff1f34ae8006c8002a086b1fdb3b5df66bd7eb3
VITE_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
VITE_RPC_URL=https://testnet.monad.network
```

## How It Works

1. **Player Authentication**: Players connect using Monad Games ID through Privy
2. **Score Tracking**: Scores are tracked throughout gameplay
3. **Blockchain Submission**: 
   - When a boss is defeated (end of wave), score is submitted
   - When game ends, final score is submitted
   - Transactions are signed with the configured private key
4. **Leaderboard Updates**: Local leaderboard updates immediately, blockchain confirms asynchronously
5. **Explorer Links**: Players can view their transactions on Monad testnet explorer

## Next Steps

### For Production:
1. Deploy a smart contract for score storage (update `VITE_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`)
2. Grant GAME_ROLE to the wallet address derived from private key
3. Consider implementing server-side API for secure key management
4. Add more robust error handling for failed transactions

### Optional Enhancements:
- Add transaction status indicators
- Implement retry logic for failed submissions
- Add more detailed player statistics
- Create tournaments/seasons functionality

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Connect wallet using "Connect Wallet" button
2. Play the game and defeat bosses
3. Check console for transaction logs
4. View leaderboard to see scores
5. Click on wallet addresses to view on explorer
